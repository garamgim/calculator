## About
While working for this challenge, I was really tempted to look at other people's solutions on the assignment webpage because it was a bit challenging compared to previous ones... Still, I made it by myself! (and with stackoverflow, mdn, ... ðŸ¤­ okay not only by myself)<br>
<br>
Now I'm moving to The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript path... Wish me luck!
